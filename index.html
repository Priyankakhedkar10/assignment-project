  <h2><i><u>"HTML (HyperText Markup Language)".</u></i></h2>

      <b>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) </b>is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web. It serves as the "skeleton" of a webpage, using a system of elements and tags to tell a web browser how to display text, images, links, and other multimedia.<br><br>
      An HTML element is a type of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) document component, one of several types of HTML nodes (some common node types include document, document fragment and attribute nodes).[1] The first used version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993 and there have since been many versions of HTML. The current de facto standard is governed by the industry group WHATWG and is known as the HTML Living Standard.<br><br>
   An HTML document is composed of a tree of simple HTML nodes, such as text nodes, and HTML elements, which add semantics and formatting to parts of a document (e.g., make text bold, organize it into paragraphs, lists and tables, or embed hyperlinks and images). Each element can have HTML attributes specified. Elements can also have content, including other elements and
    text.

   <h2><i><u>"Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)".</u></i></h2>

           <br>
           <div>
           <b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b> is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language, such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML, or XHTML).[2] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.<br>
         CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[4] This separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.<br>

           <b>JavaScript (JS)</b>  is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995. As of 2025, the overwhelming majority of websites (98.9%) uses JavaScript for client side webpage behavior.<br>
         Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.<br>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time–compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[12] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).<br>
